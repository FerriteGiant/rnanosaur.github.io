Before assembling NanoSaur you need to solder the expansion board to connect the NVIDIA Jetson Nano to the Adafruit motor board.

You have tree ways to build the expansion board:
1. Assembly on a matrix board the adapter
2. Make a PCB and solder it
3. Buy the adapter

If you chose the number **1.** follow this steps otherwise let's go to the [next step](/assembly).
